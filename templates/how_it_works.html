            Faraday's principle of magnetic induction is the basis of near-field coupling
            between a Reader and Tag. </p>
        <p>A Reader passes a large alternating current through
            a reading coil, resulting in an alternating magnetic field in its locality. </p>

        <p>If you place a Tag that incorporates a smaller coil in this
            field, an alternating voltage will appear across it. If this voltage is rectified
            and coupled to a capacitor, a reservoir of charge accumulates, which you can then
            use to power the Tag chip.</p>

        <p>Tags that use near-field coupling send data back to the Reader using-load modulation.
            This current is proportional to the load
            applied to the Tag's coil (hence load modulation).</p>
        <p>RFID Tags based on far-field
            emissions capture EM waves propagating from a dipole antenna
            attached to the Reader. A smaller dipole antenna in the Tag receives this
            energy as an alternating potential difference that appears across the arms
            of the dipole. </p>

        <p>A diode can rectify this potential and link it to a capacitor,
            which will result in an accumulation of energy in order to power its electronics.
            However, unlike the inductive designs, the Tags beyond the range of the Reader's
            near field, can't transmitted information back to the Reader using load
            modulation.
